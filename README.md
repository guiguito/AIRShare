All you have to is to click on the share button anywhere in Android, select AIRShare then
another device(desktop PC, Android Phone, iPhone, etc ...) on the same wifi network can get the data
via several ways:

## Support
This app was made for fun to find original technical solutions to share data between devices.
I don't  plan to provide any support neither to update it. But who knows ...
Therefore i took the time to release it as open source. it might be useful to someone.
Do not hesitate to modify it, update it, or fork it. I already there are many improvements that can
be made.

This app uses other open source libraries :
- NanoHttpd
- Android Query
- Apache Commons lang
- butterknife
- ZXing
- aFileChooser
- Licences Dialog
